In Multilevel Feedback Queue scheduling, processes which complete the time slice they have been allotted are demoted to a lower-level queue, and processes at lower-level queues who have not received processor time are promoted to higher queues after some time to prevent starvation, and if there is a process could be going on for too long it will not consume too much processor time over other essential system processes due to its demotion.  When a process relinguishes control of the CPU to fulfill its I/O requirements, the idea to place it at the tail of the same queue instead of a lower level one may be because stopping for I/O requirements does not indicate that a processor will go one for too long and consume CPU time. However since such processes are not being demoted, if indeed they are consuming disproportionately high amounts of process time, they could cause a slowdown since they are not being demoted


A syscall trace is implemented which (when a syscall is being called) prints out the id of the process calling it, the name of the syscall, its arguments and return value, and is implemented using the user file strace.c, with strace <command> used to run it in the CLI.<br>
The trace syscall sets various variables of the process calling it appropriately so that it is traced, and then exec is run. A new property is_trace has been added to the structure proc to indicate whether a process should be traced, and new arrays syscall_args, syscall_returns and syscall_ids have been added as elements of the process to hold the corresponding vales of all syscalls of the process. When the process is sbout to exit, if is_trace is 1, then the values in the arrays are printed appropriately. Default values of the variabels are set in proc_alloc. 'Mask' has also been added as an element of the structure to hold the argument passed to trace.
